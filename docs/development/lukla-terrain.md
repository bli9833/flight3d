# Lukla terrain provenance and accuracy

The surrounding terrain uses the public Copernicus GLO-30 **surface** model
(including vegetation/buildings), not a surveyed bare-earth model. There are no
procedural mountain walls, departure trenches, or invented Himalayan ridges.
The temporary pre-load fallback is explicitly unloaded and flat.

## Rebuild

Use Python with `rasterio==1.5.2`, `numpy==2.5.4`, and `Pillow==13.0.0`, then run:

```sh
python -m pip install -r scripts/terrain/requirements.txt
python scripts/terrain/build-lukla.py
```

Downloads are cached in `.cache/terrain`. The builder verifies the source DEM
SHA-256 and records its URL, output checksum, projection, imagery tile checksums,
and independent source checkpoints in `public/terrain/lukla_metadata.json`.
Imagery tiles can change upstream; preserve the cache for byte-identical imagery.
Normal application builds/tests do not need Python or network access.

## Coordinates and resolution

Origin: 27.6868342 N, 86.7294519 E, the midpoint of endpoints of
[OSM runway way 1257098603](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/1257098603), retrieved
2026-10-19 (endpoint nodes 11687310127 and 11687310128). This is a public-map
alignment reference, **not surveyed threshold coordinates**. The previous origin
27.6878 N, 86.7314 E was near the northeast end rather than the runway midpoint.

Both assets are reprojected to a WGS84 azimuthal equidistant grid centered there.
World X is east; world Z is south. DEM rows run north to south. The 22 km square
contains 513 × 513 Float32 little-endian samples at 42.96875 m spacing; the source
is one arc second (nominal 30 m). The main render mesh remains about 86 m, with a
10 m local airport mesh. That local tessellation adds no new measured detail.
Texture UVs map the same local-meter square; a Web Mercator tile mosaic is no
longer stretched onto an unrelated square or offset a second time at runtime.

## Deliberate approximations

Runway dimensions, heading 058°, 11.76% slope, and 2805–2867 m threshold heights
remain the existing **simulator airport model**, not newly verified survey data.
The new DSM is roughly 20 m below that model near the runway. We do not shift the
regional DEM to hide this difference: only the runway/apron footprint is graded
and smoothly blended to the source within 50 m longitudinally / 30 m laterally
(apron: 20 m). Outside that footprint `getHeight` equals `getNaturalHeight`.
Airport buildings, runway structures, and published airport altitude should be
reconciled against a surveyed airport model separately; this change establishes
traceable regional terrain rather than claiming exact airport reconstruction.

PR #41's render-only recess beneath the asphalt is retained. Collision/gear use
the graded analytical surface. The coarse mesh is lowered under the local mesh
to avoid overlapping surfaces; that is rendering accommodation, not DEM data.

The autonomous circuit is an entertainment scenario, not a real approach route.
Verify it against measured terrain rather than cutting terrain to fit its route.
Check hardware GPU renderer identity, loaded DEM state, approach/overhead/rollout
captures, camera motion, and physics clearance. The historical benchmark's exit
code alone is insufficient: its stage-5 completion predicate misses idle -1.

## Near-surface rendering

The satellite imagery retains its georeferenced UVs. `luklaSurfaceMaterial.js`
adds distance-faded, metre-scale procedural color variation and surface-gradient
bump shading. Steep slopes receive stronger rock strata; gentler slopes retain
a grass tint. Three-dimensional local-metre sampling avoids stretched detail on
cliffs and seams between the regional and airport terrace meshes. This detail
is an artistic surface treatment, not additional surveyed geometry: DEM heights,
collision queries, airport grading and mesh density are unchanged. The detail
fades between 250 and 2200 metres to retain the distant satellite appearance.

# City buildings (issue #11)

## Assets and placement

The selected building kit is original to Flight3d: three modular silhouettes
(stepped office tower, residential block and commercial block) and a 2 x 2
facade/window/rooftop atlas generated at runtime by
[`CityBuildingAssets.js`](../../src/environment/CityBuildingAssets.js). Source URL:
https://github.com/yt7good/flight3d/blob/codex/issue-11-city-buildings/src/environment/CityBuildingAssets.js.
Creator: Flight3d contributors, 2026. License: [MIT for these original
assets](../../src/environment/CITY_ASSETS_LICENSE.txt). The source and generated
art can be included in this repository and distributed by the web build. Fab,
ambientCG and Poly Haven were considered in the issue, but no third-party item
was purchased or downloaded. The earlier single plain box is replaced by three
procedural geometries; no external texture request is made.

Buildings retain the three existing city clusters and original size formula.
Their positions and colors are generated with the same random sequence; the
review's fixed seed places 539 baseline and 537 current buildings. The two
removed footprints crossed the runway exclusion boundary even though their
centers did not. The remaining 537 centers match the baseline exactly.

Each archetype uses one near and one far `InstancedMesh`. Near meshes use the
atlas for facade, window and rooftop panels; distant meshes are plain boxes.
LOD selects near instances within 1800 m of the camera and updates when the
camera moves at least 80 m. A shared emissive mask lights a bounded subset of
windows; intensity reaches zero at midday and at most 0.75 at night. The demo
director and manual time controls both update it. No bloom or point lights are
created for individual windows.

`buildingData` records the rotated world AABB width/depth, base elevation and
full height. The near and far meshes stay inside the same envelope; the
collision grid and aircraft probe checks use that AABB. Unit tests cover the
actual geometry bounds, airport exclusion, LOD totals and a rotated footprint.

## Reproduce visual and performance evidence

From the repository root, start `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1` and run:

```sh
node scripts/verify-city-buildings.mjs
node --test tests/cityBuildings.test.js tests/collision.test.js
```

The browser script compares commit `28559fc` with the current code at the same
1440 x 900 resolution, seeded building positions, camera poses and noon/23:00
lighting. Only the baseline's random calls are routed through an injected seed;
its geometry and materials are unchanged. The isolated scene uses flat ground
and excludes trees from rendering so city cost is measurable. It asserts that
all current centers existed in the baseline. Eight screenshots and raw metrics
are in [review-artifacts/city-buildings](../../review-artifacts/city-buildings/).

Host: Intel N95, headless Chrome 154, ANGLE Vulkan SwiftShader. Draw calls
include the ground plane. Frame samples are wall times for isolated rendering
plus `gl.finish`, after five warmups, with 20 samples per pose. They are not
full-flight frame rates or GPU timer-query measurements.

| View | Buildings | Calls before → after | Triangles before → after | Median ms before → after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| East near, noon | 539 → 537 | 2 → 7 | 6,470 → 8,414 | 0.3 → 0.3 |
| East skyline, noon | 539 → 537 | 2 → 4 | 6,470 → 6,446 | 0.2 → 0.4 |
| North near, noon | 539 → 537 | 2 → 7 | 6,470 → 8,174 | 0.2 → 0.2 |
| East near, 23:00 | 539 → 537 | 2 → 7 | 6,470 → 8,414 | 0.2 → 0.2 |

Texture storage rises from zero to an estimated 699,051 bytes for two 256 x
256 RGBA8 atlases including mipmaps. This is a CPU-side format estimate, not
measured VRAM. The atlases have **zero separate network transfer bytes** because
they are generated from code. The production JavaScript bundle at the same
lockfile grows from 1,124,392 to 1,130,976 bytes, or from 295,877 to 297,823
bytes with gzip. These are local build sizes, not live CDN transfer statistics.
The browser results include the individual median and p95 samples for all poses.

The existing browser crash suite reached and passed its city skyscraper impact
scenario with the new buildings. The suite's subsequent quick-restart check
stalled in headless Chrome and was stopped; no full-suite pass is claimed.

## Low-pass detail update

The near archetypes now include podiums, stepped upper volumes, corner fins or
end piers, roof parapets and rooftop plant. All parts remain within the original
normalized footprint and height, preserving placement and collision envelopes.
The far box geometry and 1,800 m LOD policy are unchanged.

The near material derives facade UVs from each instance's physical dimensions.
The existing atlas repeats at approximately 3.75 m per bay and 3 m per floor,
so tall buildings gain floors instead of stretching five windows over their
whole height. Daytime color and nighttime emission use the same mapping;
horizontal roof faces keep their original atlas UVs. One material and the same
instanced batches are retained.

GLB was not required for this update: changing the container would not correct
stretched facades, and the existing modular geometry already supports shared
materials, instancing and LOD. A unique landmark needing a hand-authored
silhouette/interior would be a separate reason to introduce a GLB asset.

For a current-main comparison, run Vite on 5187 and reuse project Chrome:

```sh
chrome-session --project flight3d node scripts/verify-city-lowpass.mjs
```

`APP_URL`, `BASELINE_REF` and `ARTIFACT_DIR` override the server, baseline and
output directory. The harness owns one tab and compares seeded city placement,
shader compilation, draw calls and far-LOD triangles across five paired views.
